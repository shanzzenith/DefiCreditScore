DeFi Credit Score System
A Trustless, On-Chain Creditworthiness Model

Objective
This project aims to develop an open-source, decentralized DeFi credit scoring system that evaluates a user's financial reputation based on their on-chain history, including wallet activity, DeFi protocol interactions, and repayment behavior. The credit score can be used for underwriting loans, risk assessment, and yield optimization in decentralized finance.

Features & Methodology
1. Wallet Activity Analysis
Track wallet age and longevity.
Monitor transaction frequency and consistency.
Evaluate wallet diversification across multiple chains, assets, LPs, and governance participation.
2. DeFi Protocol Engagement
Assess borrowing and lending behavior across Aave, Compound, Morpho, etc.
Analyze liquidity pool (LP) participation in Uniswap, Curve, Balancer pools.
Consider staking history (e.g., Lido, Marinade, EigenLayer).
Factor in governance participation (voting, proposal submissions).
3. Loan Repayment & Liquidation History
Evaluate loan repayment consistency (late payments, defaults, liquidations).
Consider liquidation risk and collateralization ratio over time.
4. Smart Contract Interaction & Risk Assessment
Identify rug pull or scam interactions.
Assess engagement with high-risk vs. established protocols.
5. Social and Behavioral Reputation
Track on-chain identity contributions (e.g., Lens, Farcaster).
Consider participation in DAOs and community initiatives.
Technical Implementation
1. Data Sources
Blockchain APIs: Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism
Data Indexing: The Graph, Dune Analytics, Nansen, Flipside Crypto
Wallet Analysis: Etherscan, Solscan, Debank API
2. Credit Score Algorithm
Use machine learning models (clustering, regression analysis) to calculate scores based on user behavior.
Define weights and risk factors for different parameters.
3. Privacy & Security
Implement ZK Proofs to allow users to prove creditworthiness without exposing full transaction history.
Ensure non-custodial and permissionless access to score calculations.
4. NFT-based Score Representation
Issue Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to represent DeFi creditworthiness.
Allow integration with DeFi lending protocols to verify scores.
Use Cases
Decentralized Lending ‚Äì Adjust borrowing limits & interest rates based on credit score.
Yield Optimization ‚Äì Premium staking & LP rewards for high-credit users.
DeFi Insurance ‚Äì Lower insurance premiums for responsible users.
DAO Reputation ‚Äì Weighted voting power based on financial responsibility.
